# Online-Shop-Service
The project is to create a simulated store-front similar to online stores. 
The interface of the store is implemented using PHP which checks user inputs and connects to SQL databases for the store inventory and implements users queries and commands. 
Finally orresponding operation results will be sent back and visualized to users.
